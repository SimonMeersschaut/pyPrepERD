"""
QuadTree data structure for efficient spatial partitioning of 2D points.

This module implements a quadtree that recursively subdivides a bounding rectangle
into four quadrants (quads) to organize points in a way that speeds up spatial queries,
such as counting points inside a given area.

Key features:
- Limits recursion depth using MAX_DEPTH to avoid excessive subdivision and Pythonâ€™s
  recursion depth limit. When MAX_DEPTH is reached, quads store points directly in a list.
- Supports counting the number of points contained within an arbitrary rectangle via
  the `containing_points` method.
- Uses rectangle helper functions from `utils.rectangle`:
    - `r1_contains_r2(rect1, rect2)`: Checks if `rect1` fully contains `rect2`.
    - `r1_intersects_r2(rect1, rect2)`: Checks if `rect1` intersects with `rect2`.

Classes:
- QuadTree: Manages the overall tree structure and root node.
- Quad: Represents an individual node in the tree. Each non-leaf node has four child quads.

Typical usage example:
    qt = QuadTree(0, 0, 100, 100)
    qt.insert(10, 10)
    qt.insert(50, 50)

    count = qt.root.containing_points(0, 0, 30, 30)
    print(count)  # Outputs how many points are inside the rectangle (0, 0, 30, 30)


We use the naming convention `quadrants`, so that we can use analogies with mathematics.
Note that Quadrants are numbered from 1 to 4 in Roman numerals as follows:

                        y
                        ^
             II         |       I
                        |
      ----------------------------------> x
                        |
            III         |       IV
                        |
